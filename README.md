# TrainScheduler
This project contains a web page that allows the user to view and create train schedules. This page was designed using Bootstrap and is responsive.

Overview
1. The page displays train schedules that include the train name, destination, frequency, next arrival, and minutes away.
2. Train schedules are stored on a firebase database. Specifically the data for train name, destination, frequency, and first train time are stored. 
3. Next train arrival and minutes away are calculate.
4. Users are allowed to create new train schedules which are immediately displayed upon submission.
5. Train schedules can be view on multiple browsers simultaneously.
6. Due to lack of funding the browser refresh button must be pressed to get current train arrival times.
